[Sakharov's Akihabara report](http://www2s.biglobe.ne.jp/~sakharov/) has a long history and it is a really useful for cheking (rowest/average) prices for computer components.
But that page does not have a good stylesheet for Google Chrome on Mac. So this script just add a style element which sets `Courier` as a `font-family` for price table elements.
